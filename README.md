# Frontend Mentor - Sunnyside Agency Landing Page

## Continued Development:
I still need to do the desktop layout for the project. 

## Description:
Landing page built with html, css (pure.css), with a hamburger menu. 
I loved the concept, design and layout of this project, I tweaked it here and there from the original design like the underline of the learn more and how the hamburger menu is presented. But overall I had so much fun building this layout, with the colour, styles and fonts.

## What I Learned:
This is the first project that I have made with a hamburger menu, I really enjoyed bulilding the layout it was a challenging one that was beautiful, and full of colour and fun aspects. When it came to the picture's that was also a good learning experience because of the fact there is so many in this project, and having them side by side and the different width's and height's was a challenge sometimes to get it to cooperate. 

## Resources:
For the hamburger menu, I googled found a menu that I liked took that and adjusted it to the code for it to be how I wanted it styled. From this website #10: https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/hamburger-menu-css/
